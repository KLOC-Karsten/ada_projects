# Ada Projects
A collection of Ada projects.


## Microbit projects

- Read Temperature : display the temperature using the temperature sensor from
  the microcontroller and from the motion sensor.


## Calliope projects
Note that the Calliope mini is very similar, but not really identical to the micro:bit. 
It uses the Bosch BMX055 as motion sensor and also has a different pin configuration. 

- Read Temperature : display the temperature using the temperature sensor from
  the microcontroller and from the motion sensor.


## Building the projects
You need GNATstudio and the Ada Driver Library to build the projects.
