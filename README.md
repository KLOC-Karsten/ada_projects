# Ada Projects
A collection of Ada projects.


## Microbit projects

- Read Temperature : display the temperature using the temperature sensor from
  the microcontroller and from the motion sensor.


## Calliope projects
Note that the Calliope mini is very similar, but not really identical to the micro:bit. 
It uses the Bosch BMX055 as motion sensor and also has a different pin configuration. 

- Read Temperature : display the temperature using the temperature sensor from
  the microcontroller and from the motion sensor.

## Nucleo F446RE
Projects for the STM32 Nucleo F446RE. 

- blinky: reads the user button of the Nucleo board and toggles the user LED. 

## Building the projects
You need GNATstudio and the Ada Driver Library to build the projects.

- Download and install the tools from [AdaCore](www.adacore.com) (for your 
  host system and the ARM target platform)

- Download and install pyocd and install additional required packs.
